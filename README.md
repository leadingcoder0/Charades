For today's meeting, we'll be playing Charades. There will be 4 rounds for each group. Each person will get to go once per patrol, and every time a person guesses the word correctly first, the patrol member will gain a point. Patrol leaders will be responsible for keeping track of points and congratulate the winner at the end.
